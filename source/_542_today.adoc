542Ma to today
--------------
Go over general environment, major changes, and some of the aforementioned big
and mean creatures

- Trilobites! They pop up in the Cambrian!

- Other cool small, weird and shelled creatures show up.

- First vertebrates resemble fish.

- Started off with just scales, then they evolved themselves a backbone.

- Taking advantage of the aforementioned Oxygenated Ocean, these fish are
  extracting it from the water around them. Gross, just like todayâ€™s fish.

- The JAWLESS FISH (not a hugely awe-inspiring name)

- Dead fish groups: Placodermi, Acanthodii

- Some creatures go to land during this time

- Lots of stuff happens

- We show up and pollute everything
