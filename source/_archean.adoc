- The Earth would not be recognizable to us today. The atmosphere was a toxic
mix of gases, including methane and ammonia.

- First life appears somewhere in this period. They mostly just hang out and
absorb ambient (heat) energy.

- The planet is still extremely volatile, with volcanoes found much more
commonly than today.

- Toward the end of this period the early life begins to evolve to take
advantage of the ambient energy provided by the sun.
