Weird and funny looking creatures, but before they get really big and mean

- This is kind of a weird era because there arenâ€™t really any predators yet.

- Also, most of the creatures in the (Oxygenated, not as salty) Ocean are pretty passive things.

- Lots of nonvertebrates.

- Most popular feature: ability to face toward incoming food stream.
