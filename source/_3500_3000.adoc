Oceans from the perspective of the first life on Earth

- Looks like we’re not too sure how life formed here, we just know it did. Also
  the oceans were filled with what we could consider toxic chemicals.

- Turns out it’s those same toxic chemicals that give the energy these little
  baby unicell organisms need to evolve.

- We’re talking weird caves at the bottom of the Ocean or other dark places,
  powered by volcanism.

- Still, these are pretty boring little things that basically just absorb heat
  and exist.

- Meanwhile, the Earth is going through crazy changes all the time and
  volcanoes are exploding everywhere all at once.

- Things that use the sun to get their energy start to grow in population at
  the end of this period.
